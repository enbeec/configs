# configs

## Python Backend

copypasta from messages I don't want to disappear:

If you’re fuzzy on how $PATH works (and variables in zsh) those are worth googling lightly to get you primed for the config snippets.
Then it’s just curl|bash install homebrew, add it to your path, brew install pyenv and 3.9.1 globally (see the repo) add THAT to your path and finally install pipenv

Verify your python version as you go and make use of the which command (which python3) to inspect what your PATH is giving you exactly
OH and it seems like you can safely install ‘python-is-python3’ to save yourself from typing the 3 :)
